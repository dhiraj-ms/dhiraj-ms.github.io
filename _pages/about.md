Hello everyone! I am Dhiraj Srivastava, pursuing double master's degree Master of Engineering in Computer Science and Master of Science in Life Science at the [Virginia Tech, USA](https://vt.edu/). My MS thesis research focuses on developing deep learning models for detecting weeds in crops and predicting yield from high-resolution aerial images under the supervision of [Dr. Vijay Singh](https://www.arec.vaes.vt.edu/arec/eastern-shore/people/vijay-singh.html). I am Graduate Research Assistant at [Eastern Shore Agricultural Research and Extension Center, Virginia Tech](https://www.arec.vaes.vt.edu/arec/eastern-shore.html) where I am involved in several agricultural projects and organizing and leading a weed science research team to build deep learning technologies for weed mapping operations.  

In the summer of 2022, I worked as a machine learning summer research intern in precision agriculture and remote sensing under USDA-ARS Graduate Summer Research Program at [High-Performance Computing Collaboratory, Mississippi State University](https://www.hpc.msstate.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Sathish Samiappan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&sortby=pubdate&user=7HJlv4IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Dr. Alessandro Matese](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro-Matese). 

I completed my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, India](https://iitbhu.ac.in/). At the end of my junior year in summer 2019, I did my summer research internship at the [University of Leicester, England](https://le.ac.uk/) under the guidance of [Prof. Eugene Yu-Dong Zhang](https://le.ac.uk/people/yudong-zhang) where I worked on developing deep learning algorithms to identify brain diseases using MRI images.

Previously I worked at [EXL, India](https://www.exlservice.com/) as a Data Scientist in the field of sports analytics for NBA, MLB, and NFL clubs. I also spent a short stint at [Augmenify, India](https://www.augmenify.com/) as a deep learning researcher, and my work was focused on developing deep learning based optical character recognition systems.

My research interests lie at the interface of computer vision and machine learning because of my interdisciplinary background comprising life science, computer science, and mechanical engineering. In the past 3-4 years from my undergraduate to MS, my interest to work in ML+Life Science grew because of projects I completed in various domains from healthcare, sports analytics, agriculture science, mechanical engineering, and finance. I’m very passionate about using Artificial Intelligence to address life science problems.
